# Intermediate Software Development Automated Teller Project
This project will be developed over the course of several assignments.  Each 
assignment will build on the work done in the previous assignment(s).  Ultimately, 
an entire system will be created to manage bank transactions for clients who 
have one or more bank accounts.

## Assignment
Assignment [01] [This assignment will produce some foundational classes to be used in an overall system. The classes will incorporate the outcomes associated with Module 01. Specifically, these classes will incorporate encapsulation through the use of private attributes and public accessors and mutators. Additionally, these classes will benefit from thorough unit testing, including unit test planning. The classes developed in this assignment will contribute to upcoming assignments. ]

Assignment[02] [This assignment will extend the BankAccount class created in your previous assignment. The BankAccount class will be used as a superclass from which more specific subclasses will be derived. Each subclass will inherit attributes and methods from the superclass, and will incorporate functionality specific to the subclass. Polymorphism will be realized by having each subclass provide their own unique implementation to a superclass method. Unit testing in this assignment will be limited to verifying the expected polymorphic behaviour.]


## Encapsulation
[use this section to explain how Encapsulation was achieved in the BankAccount and Transaction classes.]
